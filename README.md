# github_gogic

Welcome to the GitHub_gogic repo! 

This is an education folder made so that you can learn about how to play with branches in github. 

The rest of the text is in the branch `readme_mods_other_branch`.
Again, merge this branch into the branch `main` so that this text and the new one are present.
